MainCourse
==========

MainCourse uses Selenium WebDriver to aid students in signing up for the courses they want. It works for online course scheduling systems, such as UF's ISIS system. MainCourse can spend hours, refreshing course selection pages - until a spot has opened up in the desired course(s), and will add that course to your schedule - so you don't have to. Currently in development.
